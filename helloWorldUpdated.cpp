Pythons in the pet trade are sourced from the wild, or from captive females that were taken from the wild ('captive-born'), or from parents that themselves were born in a captive setting ('captive-bred')??? And that despite controversy that has arisen from media reports, with proper safety procedures pet pythons are relatively safe to own??!!\n";
